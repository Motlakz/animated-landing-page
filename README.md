## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See rotating social media icons on a different area of the page.
- Be redirected to a form after clicking the 'Sign Up' button.

### My Process

I watched a code-along tutorial and took notes for future reference. Built along with it and altered some elements according to my own preferences, then applied my own styles and colors. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to implement some basic CSS Layout propeties and apply CSS Animations to a static landing page.

### Continued development

I will spend more time working on websites with interactive CSS animations, paired with some JavaScript concepts to make them more vibrant.

### Useful resources

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6wlnpTUMDs&list=WL) - This is a great resource for code-along projects. I linked the tutorial I used for the project.
